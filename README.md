Updated Decoders and Rules for ingesting FortiOS syslog events into Wazuh/ossec

These rules are modified versions of the rules supplied by Wazuh for FortiOS 5. I have updated them to decode the changes made in FortiOS syslog output post 5.2 (presumably when the change occurred). Any rights for these Decoders and Rules falls under Wazuh. I take no responsibility for the accuracy and efficiency of these rules nor do I provide any guarantees. If you use them it is by your own choice.
